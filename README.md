# Meet The Replacements 2018 Orlando Fringe Set Piece Code
This was the code that programmed the arduino controlling the LEDs installed for the setpiece used in the theatre show during the 2018 Orlando Fringe show called Meet The Replacements.

## Summary
I have included some of the libraries that were necessary to run the code based on Adafruits neopixels if you want to try to run it. You may have to install separate chipset drivers depending if you're using a knock-off arduino or the real arduino (an FTDI chipset driver for example). And you must have Arduino already installed to compile and run the code, as most of the libraries are necessary to run through the Arduino IDE. Im curious to know if it still works! :)

I also placed some other test code just for fun and a pin out sheet for several different models of arduinos. As any of this code could be ran on any ATmega chip given theres enough memory for your project.

Happy Coding!!
